    <p>Hi! My name is Jordan Barringer. I have been trying to teach myself programming for about a year now, but have hit many roadblocks that have already begun to crumble with the help of the UT of Austin Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I hope to one day learn C++ and use my knowledge to further enhance the world of video games. Some of my favorite games are Abzu, The Last of Us, and Kingdom Hearts!</p>
